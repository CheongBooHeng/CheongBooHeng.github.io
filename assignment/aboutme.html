            <p>I watched badminton matches with my father since I was a child, and I may have become interested in
                badminton at that time. So when I was 8 years old, I signed up for the badminton training class with my
                brother. We go to practice together every Friday.</p>

            <p>I used to represent my school in competitions, but lost to other schools in the first game because I was
                too nervous. As for why I can represent the school to participate in the competition. Because I won the
                first place in the men's singles in the school's badminton competition and the competition held by the
                Fujian Guild Hall.</p>

            <p>Playing football was also one of my hobbies in middle school. After class, my friends and I will play
                football on the grass. Every time I enter the class, I must be sweating profusely. Because of this, our
                football is confiscated by the teacher every time. Of course, there is no exception when school is over,
                we will play football with classes that are older than us.</p>
